## 1.
My brethren, ye cannot have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, and yet have respect to persons.
## 2.
Now if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment,
## 3.
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or, Sit here under my footstool,
## 4.
Are ye not then in yourselves partial judges, and become evil in your thoughts?
## 5.
Hearken, my beloved brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him?
## 6.
But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?
## 7.
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
## 8.
If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well;
## 9.
But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
## 10.
For whosoever shall, save in one point, keep the whole law, he is guilty of all.
## 11.
For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
## 12.
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
## 13.
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
## 14.
What profit is it, my brethren, for a man to say he hath faith and hath not works? Can faith save him?
## 15.
Yea, a man may say, I will show thee I have faith without works; but I say, Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.
## 16.
For if a brother or sister be naked and destitute, and one of you say, Depart in peace; be warmed and filled, notwithstanding he give not those things which are needful to the body, what profit is your faith unto such?
## 17.
Even so, faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone.
## 18.
Therefore, wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead and cannot save you?
## 19.
Thou believest there is one God; thou doest well; the devils also believe and tremble; thou hast made thyself like unto them, not being justified.
## 20.
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works when he had offered Isaac, his son, upon the altar?
## 21.
Seest thou how works wrought with his faith and by works was faith made perfect?
## 22.
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
## 23.
Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
## 24.
Likewise also, Rahab, the harlot, was justified by works when she had received the messengers and sent them out another way.
## 25.
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.
