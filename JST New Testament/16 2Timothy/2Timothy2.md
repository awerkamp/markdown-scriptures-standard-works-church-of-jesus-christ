Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to the gospel,
## 9.
Wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

For this is a faithful saying: If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him;

## 22.

## 23.
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
