## 1.
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
## 2.
For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
## 3.
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.
## 4.
Who art thou that judgest another man\'s servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand.
## 5.
One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
## 6.
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks.
## 7.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
## 8.
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord\'s.
## 9.
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
## 10.
But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
## 11.
For I live, saith the Lord, as it is written: And every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall swear to God.
## 12.
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
## 13.
Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother\'s way.
## 14.
I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
## 15.
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, thou walkest not charitably if thou eatest. Therefore, destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
## 16.
Let not then your good be evil spoken of;
## 17.
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
## 18.
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men.
## 19.
Let us, therefore, follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another.
## 20.
For meat, destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense.
## 21.
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
## 22.
Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
## 23.
And he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
