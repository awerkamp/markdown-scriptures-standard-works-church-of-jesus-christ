## 1.
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power in the church but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.
## 2.

## 10.
Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.
## 11.
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

## 14.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to gratify the lusts thereof.
