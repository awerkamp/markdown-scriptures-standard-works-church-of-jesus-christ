## 1.
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
## 2.
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
## 3.
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How much more things that pertain to this life?
## 4.
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
## 5.
I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you? No, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
## 6.
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
## 7.
Now, therefore, there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
## 8.
Nay, ye do wrong and defraud, and that your brethren.
## 9.
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
## 10.
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.
## 11.
And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
## 12.
All these things are not lawful unto me, and all these things are not expedient. All things are not lawful for me, therefore, I will not be brought under the power of any.
## 13.
Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
## 14.
And God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us by his own power.
## 15.
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid.
## 16.
What! Know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? For two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
## 17.
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
## 18.
Flee fornication. Every sin that a man committeth is against the body of Christ, and he who committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
## 19.
What! Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
## 20.
For ye are bought with a price; therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God\'s.
