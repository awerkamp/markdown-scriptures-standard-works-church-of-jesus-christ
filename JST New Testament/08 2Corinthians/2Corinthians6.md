## 1.
We then, as workers together with Christ, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain,
## 2.
(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee; behold, now is the day of salvation),
## 3.
Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed,
## 4.
But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God: in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
## 5.
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
## 6.
By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
## 7.
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
## 8.
By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;
## 9.
As unknown and yet well known; as dying and, behold, we live; as chastened and not killed;
## 10.
As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
## 11.
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you; our heart is enlarged.
## 12.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
## 13.
Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.
## 14.
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?
## 15.
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
## 16.
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God. As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
## 17.
Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye the separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
## 18.
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
