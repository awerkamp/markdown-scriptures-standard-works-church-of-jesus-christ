## 1.
And it came to pass that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,
## 2.
And spake unto him, saying, Tell us by what authority doest thou these things? Or who is he who gave thee this authority?
## 3.
And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing. Answer me.
## 4.
The baptism of John\--was it from heaven or of men?
## 5.
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
## 6.
And if we say, Of men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
## 7.
And they answered that they could not tell whence it was.
## 8.
Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
## 9.
Then began he to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
## 10.
And at the season of the harvest, he sent his servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.
## 11.
And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
## 12.
And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.
## 13.
Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
## 14.
But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
## 15.
So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, therefore, shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
## 16.
He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, God forbid!
## 17.
And he beheld them and said, What is this then which is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
## 18.
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
## 19.
And the chief priests and the scribes, the same hour, sought to lay hands on him; but they feared the people; for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
## 20.
And they watched him and sent forth spies, who should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so doing, they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
## 21.
And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly; neither regardest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly.
## 22.
Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no?
## 23.
But he perceived their craftiness and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
## 24.
Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and said, Caesar\'s.
## 25.
And he said unto them, Render, therefore, unto Caesar the things which be Caesar\'s, and unto God the things which be God\'s.
## 26.
And they could not take hold of his words before the people, and they marveled at his answer and held their peace.
## 27.
Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, who deny there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
## 28.
Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, saying, If any man\'s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
## 29.
There were, therefore, seven brethren; the first took a wife and died without children.
## 30.
And the second took her to wife and died childless.
## 31.
And the third took her in like manner, and the seven also; and they left no children and died.
## 32.
And last of all, the woman died also.
## 33.
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? For seven had her to wife.
## 34.
And Jesus, answering, said unto them, The children of this world marry and are given in marriage;
## 35.
But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, through resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.
## 36.
Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
## 37.
Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
## 38.
For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.
## 39.
Then certain of the scribes, answering, said, Master, thou hast well said.
## 40.
And after that, they durst not ask him any question at all.
## 41.
And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David\'s son?
## 42.
And David himself said in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
## 43.
Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
## 44.
David, therefore, calleth him Lord. How is he then his son?
## 45.
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
## 46.
Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts,
## 47.
Who devour widows\' houses and, for a show, make long prayers; the same shall receive greater damnation.
