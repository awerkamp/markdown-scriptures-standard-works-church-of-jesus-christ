## 1.
And the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate.
## 2.
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
## 3.
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Yea, thou sayest it.
## 4.
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and people, I find no fault in this man.
## 5.
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee, to this place.
## 6.
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.
## 7.
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod\'s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
## 8.
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see him, of a long time, because he had heard many things of him and hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
## 9.
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
## 10.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
## 11.
And Herod with his men of war set him at naught, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
## 12.
And the same day, Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before this they were at enmity between themselves.
## 13.
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,
## 14.
Said unto them, You have brought this man unto me, as one who perverteth the people; and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him.
## 15.
No, nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him;
## 16.
I will, therefore, chastise him and release him.
## 17.
For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.
## 18.
But they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas,
## 19.
Who, for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder, was cast into prison.
## 20.
Pilate, therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
## 21.
But they cried, saying, Crucify him! Crucify him!
## 22.
And he said unto them the third time, Why? What evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will, therefore, chastise him and let him go.
## 23.
And they were instant in loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
## 24.
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
## 25.
And he released unto them him who for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired, and delivered Jesus to their will.
## 26.
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country; and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
## 27.
And there followed him a great company of people and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.
## 28.
But Jesus turned unto them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
## 29.
For behold, the days are coming in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
## 30.
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
## 31.
And if these things are done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry tree?
## 32.
This he spake, signifying the scattering of Israel and the desolation of the heathen, or in other words, the Gentiles.
## 33.
And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
## 34.
And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
## 35.
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do (meaning the soldiers who crucified him). And they parted his raiment and cast lots.
## 36.
And the people stood beholding; and the rulers also with them derided, saying, He saved others; let him save himself if he be the Christ, the chosen of God.
## 37.
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
## 38.
And saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.
## 39.
And a superscription also was written over him, in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
## 40.
And one of the malefactors who was crucified with him railed on him, saying, If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.
## 41.
But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
## 42.
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss.
## 43.
And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
## 44.
And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.
## 45.
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
## 46.
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
## 47.
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
## 48.
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
## 49.
And all the people who came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts and returned.
## 50.
And all his acquaintance and women who followed him from Galilee stood afar off, beholding these things.
## 51.
And behold, a man named Joseph\--a counselor, a good man and a just one,
## 52.
The same day had not consented to the counsel and deed of them, a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God\--
## 53.
He went unto Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
## 54.
And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher which was hewed in a stone, wherein never man before was laid.
## 55.
And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.
## 56.
And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after and beheld the sepulcher and how his body was laid.
## 57.
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.
