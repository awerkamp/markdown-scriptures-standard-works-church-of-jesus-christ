## 1.
Then he called his twelve disciples together, and he gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases.
## 2.
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
## 3.
And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey\--neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
## 4.
And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide until ye depart thence.
## 5.
And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
## 6.
And they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
## 7.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Jesus; and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that John was risen from the dead;
## 8.
And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
## 9.
And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
## 10.
And the apostles, when they returned, told Jesus all that they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into a solitary place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
## 11.
And the people, when they knew it, followed him; and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them who had need of healing.
## 12.
And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals; for we are here in a solitary place.
## 13.
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have but five loaves and two fishes; and except we should go and buy meat, we can provide no more food for all this multitude.
## 14.
For they were in number about five thousand men. And Jesus said unto his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
## 15.
And they did so, and made them all sit down.
## 16.
Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
## 17.
And they did eat and were all filled. And there was taken up of the fragments which remained, twelve baskets.
## 18.
And it came to pass, as he went alone with his disciples to pray, he asked them, saying, Who say the people that I am?
## 19.
They, answering, said, Some say John the Baptist; but others say Elias; and others that one of the old prophets is risen again.
## 20.
He said unto them, But who say ye that I am? Peter, answering, said, The Christ, the Son of God.
## 21.
And he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man of him,
## 22.
Saying, the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
## 23.
And he said unto them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
## 24.
For whosoever will save his life must be willing to lose it for my sake; and whosoever will be willing to lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
## 25.
For what doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and yet he receive him not whom God hath ordained, and he lose his own soul, and he himself be a castaway?
## 26.
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own kingdom, clothed in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.
## 27.
Verily, I tell you of a truth: There are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God coming in power.
## 28.
And it came to pass eight days after these sayings, that he took Peter, and John, and James and went up into a mountain to pray.
## 29.
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was changed; and his raiment became white and glittering.
## 30.
And behold, there came and talked with him two men, even Moses and Elias,
## 31.
Who appeared in glory and spake of his death and also his resurrection, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
## 32.
But Peter and they who were with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
## 33.
And after the two men departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he said.
## 34.
While he thus spake, there came a cloud and overshadowed them all; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
## 35.
And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
## 36.
And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And these things they kept close, and they told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
## 37.
And it came to pass on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
## 38.
And behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is mine only child.
## 39.
And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him, that he foameth, and bruising him hardly, departeth from him.
## 40.
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
## 41.
And Jesus, answering, said, O faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
## 42.
And as he was coming, the devil threw him down and tore him again. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
## 43.
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered, everyone, at all the things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
## 44.
Let these sayings sink down into your hearts; for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
## 45.
But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them that they perceived it not; and they feared to ask him of that saying.
## 46.
Then there arose a reasoning among them, who of them should be greatest.
## 47.
And Jesus, perceiving the thoughts of their hearts, took a child and set him in the midst,
## 48.
And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him who sent me; for he who is least among you all, the same shall be great.
## 49.
And John spake and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbade him because he followeth not with us.
## 50.
And Jesus said unto him, Forbid not any; for he who is not against us is for us.
## 51.
And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
## 52.
And sent messengers before his face; and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him.
## 53.
And the Samaritans would not receive him because his face was turned as though he would go to Jerusalem.
## 54.
And when his disciples, James and John, saw that they would not receive him, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elias did?
## 55.
But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
## 56.
For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men\'s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
## 57.
And it came to pass as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
## 58.
And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.
## 59.
And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
## 60.
Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
## 61.
And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house.
## 62.
And Jesus said unto him, No man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.
