## 1.
Now when he had ended all these sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
## 2.
And a certain centurion\'s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and ready to die.
## 3.
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
## 4.
And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this;
## 5.
For he loveth our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.
## 6.
Then Jesus went with them; and when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.
## 7.
Wherefore, neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee; but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
## 8.
For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers; and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
## 9.
When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people who followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
## 10.
And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.
## 11.
And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him and much people.
## 12.
Now, when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and many people of the city were with her.
## 13.
And now, the Lord saw her and had compassion on her, and he said unto her, Weep not.
## 14.
And he came and touched the bier; and they who bare it stood still, and he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
## 15.
And he who was dead sat up and began to speak; and he delivered him to his mother.
## 16.
And there came a fear on all; and they glorified God, saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that God hath visited his people.
## 17.
And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region round about.
## 18.
And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.
## 19.
And John, calling two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?
## 20.
When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he who should come, or look we for another?
## 21.
And in the same hour, he cured many of infirmities, and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many blind he gave sight.
## 22.
Then Jesus, answering, said unto them, Go your way and tell John what things ye have seen and heard: how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and to the poor the gospel is preached.
## 23.
And blessed are they who shall not be offended in me.
## 24.
And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John; What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind? or a man clothed in soft raiment?
## 25.
Behold, they who are gorgeously appareled and live delicately are in kings\' courts.
## 26.
But what went ye out for to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, And much more than a prophet.
## 27.
This is the one of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
## 28.
For I say unto you, Among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
## 29.
And all the people who heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
## 30.
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized of him.
## 31.
And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like?
## 32.
They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped for you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned for you, and ye have not wept.
## 33.
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say he hath a devil.
## 34.
The Son of Man is come, eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
## 35.
But wisdom is justified of all her children.
## 36.
And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee\'s house and sat down to meat.
## 37.
And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee\'s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
## 38.
And stood at his feet weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment.
## 39.
Now when the Pharisee who had bidden him saw this, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who or what manner of woman this is who toucheth him; for she is a sinner.
## 40.
And Jesus, answering, said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he said, Master, say on.
## 41.
And Jesus said, There was a certain creditor, who had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
## 42.
And when he found they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most?
## 43.
Simon answered and said, I suppose the man to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
## 44.
And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
## 45.
Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
## 46.
My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
## 47.
Wherefore, I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
## 48.
And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
## 49.
And they who sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
## 50.
And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
