## 1.
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed;
## 2.
Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind,
## 3.
Neither as being lords over God\'s heritage but being ensamples to the flock.
## 4.
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
## 5.
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
## 6.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,
## 7.
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
## 8.
Be sober. Be vigilant because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour\--
## 9.
Whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
## 10.
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
## 11.
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
## 12.
By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
## 13.
They at Babylon, elected together with you, salute you; and so doth Marcus, my son.
## 14.
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
