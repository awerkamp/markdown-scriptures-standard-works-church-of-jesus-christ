## 1.
And he went out from thence and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him.
## 2.
And when the Sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue; and many, hearing, were astonished at his words, saying, From whence hath this man these things?
## 3.
And what wisdom is this that is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
## 4.
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and of Judah and Simon?
## 5.
And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
## 6.
But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
## 7.
And he could do no mighty work there, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and they were healed.
## 8.
And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
## 9.
And he called the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits, and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only\--no scrip, nor bread, nor money in their purse\--but should be shod with sandals, and not take two coats.
## 10.
And he said unto them, In whatsoever place ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
## 11.
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust of your feet for a testimony against them.
## 12.
Verily, I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
## 13.
And they went out and preached that men should repent.
## 14.
And they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick, and they were healed.
## 15.
And King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name was spread abroad; and he said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and, therefore, mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
## 16.
Others said that it is Elias; and others said that it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
## 17.
But when Herod heard of him, he said, It is John whom I beheaded; he is risen from the dead.
## 18.
For Herod himself had sent forth, and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias\' sake, his brother Philip\'s wife; for he had married her.
## 19.
For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother\'s wife.
## 20.
Therefore, Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him; but she could not.
## 21.
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and a holy man, and one who feared God and observed to worship him; and when he heard him, he did many things for him and heard him gladly.
## 22.
But when Herod\'s birthday was come, he made a supper for his lords, high captains, and the chief priests of Galilee.
## 23.
And when the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
## 24.
And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
## 25.
And she went forth and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
## 26.
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked, saying, I will that thou give me, by and by, in a charger, the head of John the Baptist.
## 27.
And the king was exceeding sorry; but for his oath\'s sake and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
## 28.
And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought; and he went, and beheaded him in the prison,
## 29.
And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
## 30.
And when John\'s disciples heard of it, they came, and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
## 31.
Now the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
## 32.
And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a solitary place and rest a while; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure, not so much as to eat.
## 33.
And they departed into a solitary place by ship, privately.
## 34.
And the people saw them departing; and many knew Jesus, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outran them, and came together unto him.
## 35.
And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people and was moved with compassion towards them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
## 36.
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him and said, This is a solitary place, and now the time for departure is come; send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
## 37.
And he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
## 38.
And they said unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat?
## 39.
He said unto them, How many loaves have ye? Go and see.
## 40.
And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes.
## 41.
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
## 42.
And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
## 43.
And when he had taken the five loaves and two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before the multitude; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
## 44.
And they did all eat and were filled.
## 45.
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.
## 46.
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
## 47.
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before him unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
## 48.
And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
## 49.
And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land; and he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them.
## 50.
And about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea as if he would have passed by them.
## 51.
And when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out;
## 52.
For they all saw him and were troubled.
## 53.
And immediately he talked with them and said unto them, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
## 54.
And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased; and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered.
## 55.
For they considered not of the loaves; for their hearts were hardened.
## 56.
And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.
## 57.
And when they were come out of the ship, straightway the people knew him, and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
## 58.
And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment; and as many as touched him were made whole.
