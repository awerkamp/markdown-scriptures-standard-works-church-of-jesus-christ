## 1.
And straightway in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes;
## 2.
And the whole council condemned him, and bound him, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
## 3.
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
## 4.
And Jesus answering, said unto him, I am, even as thou sayest.
## 5.
And the chief priests accused him of many things; but he answered nothing.
## 6.
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee.
## 7.
But Jesus yet answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.
## 8.
Now it was common at the feast for Pilate to release unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
## 9.
And there was a man named Barabbas, bound with them who had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
## 10.
And the multitude, crying aloud, began to desire him to deliver Jesus unto them.
## 11.
But Pilate answered unto them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
## 12.
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
## 13.
But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas unto them, as he had before done unto them.
## 14.
And Pilate spake again and said unto them, What will ye then that I shall do with him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
## 15.
And they cried out again, Deliver him unto us to be crucified. Away with him! Crucify him!
## 16.
Then Pilate said unto them, Why? What evil hath he done?
## 17.
But they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him!
## 18.
And now Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
## 19.
And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium; and they called together the whole band;
## 20.
And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head,
## 21.
And began to salute him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
## 22.
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and, bowing their knees, worshiped him.
## 23.
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
## 24.
And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
## 25.
And they brought him unto the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a burial.
## 26.
And they gave him to drink, vinegar mingled with gall; and when he had tasted the vinegar, he would not drink.
## 27.
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
## 28.
And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
## 29.
And Pilate wrote his accusation and put it upon the cross: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
## 30.
There were certain of the chief priests, who stood by, that said unto Pilate, Write that he said, I am the King of the Jews.
## 31.
But Pilate said unto them, What I have written, I have written.
## 32.
And with him they crucified two thieves, the one on his right hand, the other on his left.
## 33.
And the scripture was fulfilled which said, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
## 34.
And they who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou who destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save thyself and come down from the cross.
## 35.
Likewise also, the chief priests, mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
## 36.
Let Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.
## 37.
And one of them who was crucified with him reviled him also, saying, If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.
## 38.
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
## 39.
And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
## 40.
And some of them who stood by, when they heard him, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
## 41.
And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink; others spake, saying, Let him alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
## 42.
And Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost.
## 43.
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
## 44.
And when the centurion, who stood over against him, saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly, this man is the Son of God.
## 45.
There were also women looking on afar off, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered unto him, and many other women who came with him unto Jerusalem.
## 46.
And now, when the even was come, because it was the preparation day, that is the day before the Sabbath,
## 47.
Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marveled and asked him if he were already dead.
## 48.
And calling the centurion, he asked him if he had been any while dead.
## 49.
And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
## 50.
And Joseph bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher.
## 51.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, beheld where he was laid.
