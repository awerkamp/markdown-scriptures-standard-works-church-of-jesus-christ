## 1.
In those days, the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said unto them,
## 2.
I have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat; and if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way; for divers of them came from afar.
## 3.
And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these, so great a multitude, with bread here in the wilderness?
## 4.
And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
## 5.
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before the people; and they did set them before the people.
## 6.
And they had a few small fishes; and he blessed them and commanded to set them also before the people, that they should eat.
## 7.
So they did eat and were filled; and they took up of the broken bread that was left, seven baskets.
## 8.
And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.
## 9.
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
## 10.
And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
## 11.
And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why doth this generation seek after a sign?
## 12.
Verily, I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation, save the sign of the prophet Jonah; for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale\'s belly, so likewise shall the Son of Man be buried in the bowels of the earth.
## 13.
And he left them; and, entering into the ship again, he departed to the other side.
## 14.
Now the multitude had forgotten to take bread; neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
## 15.
And he charged them, saying, Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
## 16.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, He hath said this because we have no bread.
## 17.
And when they said this among themselves, Jesus knew it; and he said unto them,
## 18.
Why reason ye because ye have no bread? Perceive ye not yet, neither understand ye? Are your hearts yet hardened?
## 19.
Having eyes, see ye not? And having ears, hear ye not? And do ye not remember?
## 20.
When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They said unto him, Twelve.
## 21.
And when the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
## 22.
And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
## 23.
And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
## 24.
And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town; and when he had spit upon his eyes and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught?
## 25.
And he looked up and said, I see men as trees walking.
## 26.
After that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up; and he was restored and saw every man clearly.
## 27.
And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town nor tell what is done to any in the town.
## 28.
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
## 29.
And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
## 30.
And he said unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
## 31.
And Peter answered and said unto him, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
## 32.
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
## 33.
And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
## 34.
And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him.
## 35.
But when he had turned about and looked upon his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
## 36.
And when he had called the people, with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
## 37.
For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; or whosoever will save his life, shall be willing to lay it down for my sake; and if he is not willing to lay it down for my sake, he shall lose it.
## 38.
But whosoever shall be willing to lose his life for my sake, and the gospel\'s, the same shall save it.
## 39.
For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
## 40.
Therefore, deny yourselves of these, and be not ashamed of me.
## 41.
Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
## 42.
And they shall not have part in that resurrection when he cometh.
## 43.
For verily, I say unto you that he shall come. And he that layeth down his life for my sake and the gospel\'s shall come with him and shall be clothed with his glory in the cloud, on the right hand of the Son of Man.
## 44.
And he said unto them again, Verily, I say unto you that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
