And again, he entered into Capernaum after many days; and it was noised abroad that he was in the house.

And they came unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four persons.
## 4.
And when they could not come nigh unto him, for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was; and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
## 5.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
## 6.
But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?
## 7.
And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? Is it not easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee, than to say, Arise, and take up thy bed and walk?
## 8.
But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the sick of the palsy, I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thy house.
## 9.
And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all, insomuch that they were all amazed, and many glorified God, saying, We never saw the power of God after this manner.
## 10.
And Jesus went forth again by the seaside, and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
## 11.
And as he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the place where they receive tribute as was customary in those days; and he said unto him, Follow me; and he arose and followed him.

And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with him and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.
## 13.
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
## 14.
When Jesus heard this, he said unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.
## 15.
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
## 16.
And they came and said unto him, The disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast; and why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
## 17.
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
## 18.
But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
## 19.
No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.

## 23.
And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was an hungered, he and they who were with him?
## 24.
How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
## 25.
And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
## 26.
Wherefore, the Sabbath was given unto man for a day of rest, and also that man should glorify God, and not that man should not eat;
## 27.
For the Son of Man made the Sabbath day; therefore, the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.
