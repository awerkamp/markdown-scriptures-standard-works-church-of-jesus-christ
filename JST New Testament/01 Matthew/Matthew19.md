## 1.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.
## 2.
And great multitudes followed him; and many believed on him, and he healed them there.
## 3.
The Pharisees came also unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
## 4.
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read that he who made man at the beginning made him, male and female,
## 5.
And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh?
## 6.
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together let not man put asunder.
## 7.
They said unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away?
## 8.
He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
## 9.
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her that is put away doth commit adultery.
## 10.
His disciples said unto him, If the case of the man be so with a wife, it is not good to marry.
## 11.
But he said unto them, All cannot receive this saying; it is not for them save to whom it is given.
## 12.
For there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother\'s womb; and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men; and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake. He that is able to receive, let him receive my sayings.
## 13.
Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them, saying, There is no need, for Jesus hath said, Such shall be saved.
## 14.
But Jesus said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
## 15.
And he laid hands on them and departed thence.
## 16.
And, behold, one came and said, Good master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
## 17.
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God; but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
## 18.
He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness.
## 19.
Honor thy father and mother. And, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
## 20.
The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up. What lack I yet?
## 21.
Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.
## 22.
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
## 23.
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily, I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
## 24.
And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
## 25.
When his disciples heard this, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
## 26.
But Jesus beheld their thoughts and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but if they will forsake all things for my sake, with God whatsoever things I speak are possible.
## 27.
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee. What shall we have therefore?
## 28.
And Jesus said unto them, Verily, I say unto you that ye who have followed me shall, in the resurrection, when the Son of Man shall come sitting on the throne of his glory, ye shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
## 29.
And everyone that has forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name\'s sake, shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life.
## 30.
But many of the first shall be last, and the last first.
