## 1.
And then, at that day before the Son of Man comes, the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
## 2.
And five of them were wise, and five of them were foolish.
## 3.
They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them; but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
## 4.
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
## 5.
And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold, the bridegroom cometh! Go ye out to meet him!
## 6.
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
## 7.
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
## 8.
But the wise answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and you, go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
## 9.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
## 10.
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us.
## 11.
But he answered and said, Verily, I say unto you, You know me not.
## 12.
Watch, therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.
## 13.
Now I will liken these things unto a parable.
## 14.
For it is like as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods.
## 15.
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to every man according to his several ability, and straightway went on his journey.
## 16.
Then he that had received the five talents went, and traded with the same, and gained other five talents.
## 17.
And, likewise, he who received two talents, he also gained other two.
## 18.
But he who had received one went, and digged in the earth, and hid his lord\'s money.
## 19.
After a long time, the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them.
## 20.
And so he that had received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have gained, besides them, five talents more.
## 21.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
## 22.
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents; behold, I have gained two talents besides them.
## 23.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
## 24.
Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee, that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not scattered.
## 25.
And I was afraid, and went, and hid thy talent in the earth; and lo, here is thy talent; take it from me as thou hast from thine other servants, for it is thine.
## 26.
His lord answered and said unto him, O wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not and gather where I have not scattered.
## 27.
Having known this, therefore, thou oughtest to have put my money to the exchangers; and at my coming, I should have received mine own with usury.
## 28.
I will take, therefore, the talent from you and give it unto him who hath ten talents.
## 29.
For unto everyone who hath obtained other talents shall be given, and he shall have in abundance.
## 30.
But from him that hath not obtained other talents shall be taken away even that which he hath received.
## 31.
And his lord shall say unto his servants, Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
## 32.
When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he shall sit upon the throne of his glory;
## 33.
And before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth sheep from the goats: the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
## 34.
And he shall sit upon his throne, and the twelve apostles with him.
## 35.
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
## 36.
For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me;
## 37.
I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
## 38.
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered and fed thee, or thirsty and gave thee drink?
## 39.
When saw we thee a stranger and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee?
## 40.
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
## 41.
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
## 42.
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
## 43.
For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
## 44.
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
## 45.
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
## 46.
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it not unto me.
## 47.
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.
