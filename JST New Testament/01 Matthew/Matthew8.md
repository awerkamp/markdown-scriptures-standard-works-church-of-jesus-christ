## 1.
And when Jesus was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
## 2.
And, behold, there came a leper worshiping him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
## 3.
And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
## 4.
And Jesus said unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
## 5.
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
## 6.
And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal him.
## 7.
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
## 8.
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
## 9.
And when they that followed him heard this, they marveled. And when Jesus heard this, he said unto them that followed,
## 10.
Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith; no, not in Israel.
## 11.
And I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
## 12.
But the children of the wicked one shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
## 13.
And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
## 14.
And when Jesus was come into Peter\'s house, he saw his wife\'s mother laid and sick of a fever.
## 15.
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered unto them.
## 16.
Now when the evening was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils; and he cast out the evil spirits with the word and healed all that were sick,
## 17.
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses.
## 18.
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side of the sea.
## 19.
And a certain scribe came unto him and said, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
## 20.
And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.
## 21.
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
## 22.
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.
## 23.
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples came unto him.
## 24.
And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.
## 25.
And his disciples came unto him and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us, else we perish.
## 26.
And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
## 27.
Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
## 28.
But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
## 29.
And when he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him a man possessed of devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass that way.
## 30.
And, behold, he cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
## 31.
And there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many swine feeding.
## 32.
So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.
## 33.
And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine; and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.
## 34.
And they that kept them fled, and went their way into the city, and told everything which took place and what was befallen the possessed of the devils.
## 35.
And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.
