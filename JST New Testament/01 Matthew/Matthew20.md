## 1.
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
## 2.
And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
## 3.
And he went out about the third hour, and found others standing idle in the market place,
## 4.
And said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you; and they went their way.
## 5.
And again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.
## 6.
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
## 7.
They said unto him, Because no man hath hired us.
## 8.
He said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, ye shall receive.
## 9.
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
## 10.
And when they came that began about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
## 11.
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received a penny, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying, These last have wrought one hour only, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.
## 12.
But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
## 13.
Take thine and go thy way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?
## 14.
Is thine eye evil because I am good?
## 15.
So the last shall be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen.
## 16.
And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them,
## 17.
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify. And the third day he shall rise again.
## 18.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee\'s children with her sons, worshiping Jesus and desiring a certain thing of him.
## 19.
And he said unto her, What wilt thou that I should do?
## 20.
And she said unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
## 21.
But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
## 22.
They said unto him, We are able.
## 23.
And he said unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is for whom it is prepared of my Father, but not mine to give.
## 24.
And when the ten heard this, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
## 25.
But Jesus called them and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them; but it shall not be so among you.
## 26.
But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.
## 27.
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant,
## 28.
Even as the Son of Man came, not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
## 29.
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
## 30.
And, behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David.
## 31.
And the multitude rebuked them, saying they should hold their peace; but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David.
## 32.
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?
## 33.
They said unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
## 34.
So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
