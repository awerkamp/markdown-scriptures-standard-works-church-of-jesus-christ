## 1.
Furthermore then, we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
## 2.
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
## 3.
For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication,
## 4.
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,
## 5.
Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God,
## 6.
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter, because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
## 7.
For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
## 8.
He, therefore, that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
## 9.
But, as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
## 10.
And, indeed, ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia; but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more,
## 11.
And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,
## 12.
That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.
## 13.
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
## 14.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
## 15.
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that they who are alive at the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them who remain unto the coming of the Lord, who are asleep.
## 16.
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
## 17.
Then they who are alive shall be caught up together into the clouds with them who remain, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.
## 18.
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.
