## 1.
And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah that is over against Jericho; and the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead unto Dan,
## 2.
And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the utmost sea,
## 3.
And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
## 4.
And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
## 5.
So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the Lord.
## 6.
For the Lord took him unto his fathers in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor; therefore, no man knoweth of his sepulcher unto this day.
## 7.
And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated.
## 8.
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
## 9.
And Joshua, the son of Nun, was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded Moses.
## 10.
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
## 11.
In all the signs and the wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
## 12.
And in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
