## 1.
Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
## 2.
He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not.
## 3.
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one and bringest me into judgment with thee?
## 4.
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
## 5.
Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
## 6.
Turn from him, that he may rest till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
## 7.
For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
## 8.
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground,
## 9.
Yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant.
## 10.
But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost. And where is he?
## 11.
As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up,
## 12.
So man lieth down and riseth not; till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.
## 13.
Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me!
## 14.
If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.
## 15.
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee; thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
## 16.
For now thou numberest my steps. Dost thou not watch over my sin?
## 17.
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
## 18.
And surely the mountain, falling, cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of his place.
## 19.
The waters wear the stones; thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
## 20.
Thou prevailest forever against him, and he passeth; thou changest his countenance and sendest him away.
## 21.
His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
## 22.
But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
