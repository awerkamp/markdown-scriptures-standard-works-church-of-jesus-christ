## 1.
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.
## 2.
I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, even from good, and my sorrow was stirred.
## 3.
My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; then spake I with my tongue,
## 4.
Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my days, what it is\--that I may know how frail I am.
## 5.
Behold, thou hast made my days as a handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee; verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
## 6.
Surely every man walketh in a vain show; surely they are disquieted in vain; he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.
## 7.
And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.
## 8.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.
## 9.
I was dumb and opened not my mouth because thou didst chasten me.
## 10.
Remove thy stroke away from me, or I shall be consumed by the blow of thy hand.
## 11.
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth; surely every man is vanity. Selah.
## 12.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears; for I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
## 13.
Oh, spare me, that I may recover strength before I go hence and be no more.
