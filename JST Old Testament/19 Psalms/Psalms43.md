[[Psalms42|<< Psalms 42]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms44|Psalms 44 >>]]
## 1.
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
## 2.
For thou art the God of my strength. Why dost thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
## 3.
Oh, send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles.
## 4.
Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
## 5.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.
