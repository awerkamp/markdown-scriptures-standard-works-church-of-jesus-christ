[[Psalms32|<< Psalms 32]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms34|Psalms 34 >>]]
## 1.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; to praise the Lord is comely for the upright in heart.
## 2.
Praise the Lord with thy voice; sing unto him with the psaltery and harp, an instrument with ten strings.
## 3.
Sing unto him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.
## 4.
For the word of the Lord is given to the upright, and all his works are done in truth.
## 5.
He loveth righteousness and judgment; the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.
## 6.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
## 7.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
## 8.
Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
## 9.
For he spake, and it was finished; he commanded, and it stood fast.
## 10.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to naught; he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
## 11.
The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
## 12.
Blessed are the nations and the people whom the Lord God hath chosen for his own inheritance.
## 13.
The Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
## 14.
From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
## 15.
He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
## 16.
There is no king saved by the multitude of a host; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
## 17.
A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
## 18.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy,
## 19.
To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in a time of famine.
## 20.
Our soul waiteth for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.
## 21.
For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.
## 22.
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in thee.
