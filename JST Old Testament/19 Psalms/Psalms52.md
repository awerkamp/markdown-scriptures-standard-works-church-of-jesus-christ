[[Psalms51|<< Psalms 51]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms53|Psalms 53 >>]]
## 1.
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The goodness of God endureth continually.
## 2.
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
## 3.
Thou lovest evil more than good, and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
## 4.
Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
## 5.
God shall likewise destroy thee forever; he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
## 6.
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him.
## 7.
Lo, the man who made not God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
## 8.
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.
## 9.
I will praise thee forever because thou hast done wonderful works; I will wait on thy name, for thou art good before thy saints.
