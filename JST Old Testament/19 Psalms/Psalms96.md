## 1.
Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
## 2.
Sing unto the Lord; bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day.
## 3.
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
## 4.
For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
## 5.
For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens.
## 6.
Honor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
## 7.
Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people; give unto the Lord glory and strength.
## 8.
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts.
## 9.
Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; fear before him, all the earth.
## 10.
Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established, that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously.
## 11.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar and the fullness thereof.
## 12.
Let the field be joyful and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice,
## 13.
Before the Lord; for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth.
