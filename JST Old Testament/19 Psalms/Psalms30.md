## 1.
I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
## 2.
O Lord, my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
## 3.
O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave; thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
## 4.
Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
## 5.
For his anger kindleth against the wicked; they repent, and in a moment it is turned away; and they are in his favor, and he giveth them life; therefore, weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
## 6.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
## 7.
Lord, by thy favor thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
## 8.
I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication.
## 9.
When I go down to the pit, my blood shall return to the dust. I will praise thee; my soul shall declare thy truth. For what profit am I if I do it not?
## 10.
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me; Lord, be thou my helper.
## 11.
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,
## 12.
To the end that my soul may give glory to thy name, and sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Lord, my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.
