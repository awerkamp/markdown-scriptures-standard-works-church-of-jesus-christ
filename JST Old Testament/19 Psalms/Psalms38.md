[[Psalms37|<< Psalms 37]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms39|Psalms 39 >>]]
## 1.
O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
## 2.
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
## 3.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
## 4.
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
## 5.
My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
## 6.
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
## 7.
For my loins are filled with a loathsome distress; and no soundness is found in my flesh.
## 8.
I am feeble, and broken, and very sore. I have wept by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
## 9.
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
## 10.
My heart panteth; my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
## 11.
My lovers and my friends stand aloof because of my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
## 12.
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long.
## 13.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
## 14.
Thus I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
## 15.
For in thee, O Lord, do I hope; thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God.
## 16.
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
## 17.
For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
## 18.
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
## 19.
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
## 20.
They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because I follow the thing that good is.
## 21.
Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me.
## 22.
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
