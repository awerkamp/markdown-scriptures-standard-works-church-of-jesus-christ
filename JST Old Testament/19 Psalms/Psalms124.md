## 1.
Now may Israel say, If the Lord was not on our side when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us.
## 2.
Then the waters had overwhelmed us; the stream had gone over our soul;
## 3.
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
## 4.
Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
## 5.
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
## 6.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
