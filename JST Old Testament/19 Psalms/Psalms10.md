[[Psalms9|<< Psalms 9]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms11|Psalms 11 >>]]
## 1.
Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
## 2.
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
## 3.
For the wicked boasteth of his heart\'s desire and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.
## 4.
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.
## 5.
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
## 6.
For he hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved\--never in adversity.
## 7.
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit; and his heart is full of fraud; and under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
## 8.
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are privily set against the poor.
## 9.
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net.
## 10.
He croucheth to the strong ones and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his devices.
## 11.
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hideth his face; he will never see it.
## 12.
Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand; forget not the humble.
## 13.
The wicked contemn God; wherefore he doth say in his heart, Thou wilt not require iniquity at my hand.
## 14.
O Lord, thou hast seen all this, for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand. The poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
## 15.
O Lord, thou wilt break the arm of the wicked and of the evil and seek out his wickedness until thou find none that remain.
## 16.
And the Lord shall be king forever and ever over his people; for the wicked shall perish out of his land.
## 17.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cause thine ear to hear,
## 18.
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
