[[Psalms14|<< Psalms 14]] | [[Psalms|Psalms]] | [[Psalms16|Psalms 16 >>]]
## 1.
Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill of Zion?
## 2.
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart;
## 3.
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor,
## 4.
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord, sweareth not falsely to hurt any man, and changeth not;
## 5.
He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
