## 1.
They that trust in the Lord in Mount Zion cannot be removed but abide forever.
## 2.
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth, even forever.
## 3.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
## 4.
Do good, O Lord, unto the good and unto the upright in their hearts.
## 5.
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace shall be upon Israel.
