## 1.
And the Lord appeared unto Abraham in the plains of Mamre. And he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day;
## 2.
And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him; and when he saw, he ran to meet them from his tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said,
## 3.
My brethren, if now I have found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray you, from thy servant.
## 4.
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree; and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on; for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do as thou hast said.
## 5.
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead, and make cakes upon the hearth.
## 6.
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf, tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
## 7.
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf, which he had dressed, and set them before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
## 8.
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah, thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
## 9.
And one of them blessed Abraham, and he said, I will certainly return unto thee from my journey; and lo, according to the time of life, Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son.
## 10.
And Sarah heard him in the tent door.
## 11.
And now Abraham and Sarah being old and stricken in age, therefore, it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women;
## 12.
Therefore, Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
## 13.
And the angel of the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is anything too hard for the Lord?
## 14.
At the time appointed, behold, I will return unto thee from my journey, which the Lord hath sent me; and according to the time of life thou mayest know that Sarah shall have a son.
## 15.
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou didst laugh.
## 16.
And the angels rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
## 17.
And the angel of the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which the Lord will do for him\--seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
## 18.
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him; and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.
## 19.
And the angel of the Lord said unto Abraham, The Lord said unto us, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous, I will destroy them.
## 20.
And I will send you, and ye shall go down now and see that their iniquities are rewarded unto them.
## 21.
And ye shall have all things done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me.
## 22.
And if ye do it not, it shall be upon your heads; for I will destroy them, and you shall know that I will do it, for it shall be before your eyes.
## 23.
And the angels, which were holy men and were sent forth after the order of God, turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom.
## 24.
But Abraham stood yet before the Lord, remembering the things which had been told him.
## 25.
And Abraham drew near to Sodom and said unto the Lord, calling upon his name, saying, Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked? Wilt thou not spare them?
## 26.
Peradventure there may be fifty righteous within the city, wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that may be therein?
## 27.
Oh, may that be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked.
## 28.
O God, may that be far from thee. For shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
## 29.
And the Lord said unto Abraham, If thou findest in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
## 30.
And Abraham answered and said, Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which is able to destroy the city and lay all the people in dust and ashes.
## 31.
Will the Lord spare them peradventure there lack five of the fifty righteous? Wilt thou destroy all the city for their wickedness if I find there forty and five righteous?
## 32.
And he said, I will not destroy, but spare them.
## 33.
And he spake unto him again and said, Peradventure there should be forty found there?
## 34.
And he said, I will not destroy it for forty\'s sake.
## 35.
And he said again unto the Lord, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there?
## 36.
And he said, I will not destroy them if thou shalt find thirty there.
## 37.
And he said, Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord. Wilt thou destroy them if peradventure there shall twenty be found there?
## 38.
And he said, I will not destroy them for twenty\'s sake.
## 39.
And Abraham said unto the Lord, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten shall be found there?
## 40.
And the Lord said, I will not destroy them for ten\'s sake. And the Lord ceased speaking with Abraham.
## 41.
And as soon as he had left communing with the Lord, Abraham went his way.
## 42.
And it came to pass that Abraham returned unto his tent.
