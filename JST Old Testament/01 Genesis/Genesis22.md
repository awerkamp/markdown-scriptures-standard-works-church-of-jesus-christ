## 1.
And it came to pass after these things, that God did try Abraham and said unto him, Abraham. And Abraham said, Behold, here am I.
## 2.
And the Lord said, Take now thy son, thine only Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I will tell thee.
## 3.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son,
## 4.
And clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
## 5.
Then on the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.
## 6.
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and worship, and come to you again.
## 7.
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon his back; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and Isaac his son; and they went both of them together.
## 8.
And Isaac spake unto Abraham, his father, and said, My father! And he said, Here am I, my son.
## 9.
And he said, Behold the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
## 10.
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. So they went both of them together, and they came to the place of which God had told him.
## 11.
And Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac, his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
## 12.
And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
## 13.
And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, Abraham! Abraham! And Abraham said, Here am I.
## 14.
And the angel said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him;
## 15.
For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only Isaac, from me.
## 16.
And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, behind a thicket, there was a ram caught in it by his horns.
## 17.
And Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
## 18.
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh, as it is said unto this day: In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
## 19.
And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said,
## 20.
Thus saith the Lord, I have sworn by myself that because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son, thine only Isaac, from me,
## 21.
That in blessing I will bless thee; and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore.
## 22.
And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice.
## 23.
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
## 24.
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,
## 25.
Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children unto thy brother Nahor; Huz is his firstborn, and Buz is his brother.
## 26.
And Kemuel is the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Haza, and Bildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel;
## 27.
And Bethuel begat Rebekah.
## 28.
These eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham\'s brother; and his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
