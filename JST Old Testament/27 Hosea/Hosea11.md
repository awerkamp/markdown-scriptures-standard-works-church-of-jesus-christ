## 1.
When Israel was a child, then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.
## 2.
As they called them, so they went from them; they sacrificed unto Baalim and burned incense to graven images.
## 3.
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
## 4.
I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
## 5.
He shall not return unto the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king because they refused to return.
## 6.
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them because of their own counsels.
## 7.
And my people are bent to backsliding from me; though they called them to the Most High, none at all would exalt him.
## 8.
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned toward thee, and my mercies are extended to gather thee.
## 9.
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man\--the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not enter into the city.
## 10.
They shall walk after the Lord; he shall roar like a lion; when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.
## 11.
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will place them in their houses, saith the Lord.
## 12.
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God and is faithful with the saints.
