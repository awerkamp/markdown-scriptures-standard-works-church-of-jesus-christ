## 1.
Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: And behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and lo, it was the latter growth after the king\'s mowings.
## 2.
And it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee. By whom shall Jacob arise? For he is small.
## 3.
And the Lord said concerning Jacob: Jacob shall repent for this; therefore, I will not utterly destroy him, saith the Lord.
## 4.
Thus hath the Lord God showed unto me: And behold, the Lord God called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep and did eat up a part.
## 5.
Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee. By whom shall Jacob arise? For he is small.
## 6.
And the Lord said concerning Jacob: Jacob shall repent of his wickedness; therefore, I will not utterly destroy him, saith the Lord God.
## 7.
Thus he showed me: And behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
## 8.
And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;
## 9.
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
## 10.
Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
## 11.
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
## 12.
Also, Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there;
## 13.
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel; for it is the king\'s chapel, and it is the king\'s court.
## 14.
Then answered Amos and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet; neither was I a prophet\'s son; but I was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit;
## 15.
And the Lord took me as I followed the flock; and the Lord said unto me, Go prophesy unto my people Israel.
## 16.
Now, therefore, hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.
## 17.
Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land; and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
