## 1.
MY son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;
## 2.
The light and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;
## 3.
Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;
## 4.
And blessed are you because you have believed;
## 5.
And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel--
## 6.
To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming.
## 7.
For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.
## 8.
And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.
## 9.
But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.
## 10.
Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.
## 11.
And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come--
## 12.
And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.
