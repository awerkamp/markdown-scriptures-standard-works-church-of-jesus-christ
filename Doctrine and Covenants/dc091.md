## 1.
VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha--There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;
## 2.
There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.
## 3.
Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.
## 4.
Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;
## 5.
And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;
## 6.
And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
