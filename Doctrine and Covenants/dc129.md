## 1.
THERE are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones--
## 2.
For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
## 3.
Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.
## 4.
When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.
## 5.
If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.
## 6.
If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear--
## 7.
Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.
## 8.
If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.
## 9.
These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God.
