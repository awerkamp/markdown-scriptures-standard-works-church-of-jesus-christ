AND the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved, what desirest thou? For if you shall ask what you will, it shall be granted unto you.
## 2.
And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me power over death, that I may live and bring souls unto thee.
## 3.
And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt tarry until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy before nations, kindreds, tongues and people.
## 4.
And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? For he desired of me that he might bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest speedily come unto me in my kingdom.
## 5.
I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do more, or a greater work yet among men than what he has before done.
## 6.
Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation who dwell on the earth.
## 7.
And I will make thee to minister for him and for thy brother James; and unto you three I will give this power and the keys of this ministry until I come.
## 8.
Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both joy in that which ye have desired.
